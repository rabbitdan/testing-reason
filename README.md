Hello Mark and other folks at Reason!

I'm just adding a quick note here offering some thoughts about things I might I might be inclined to do with more time.
It's been a while since I've done anything in raw Vue as I normally use Nuxt which bootstraps a bunch of things and or just does them differently. 
So I've had to do a bit of a refresher on some things! 
- I'd do more way more in SASS, mainly adding variables and mixins most specifically using a mixin for media queries. Also, SCSS would be a it more organised.
- I'd want to talk with a PM about wider IA and UI questions. How consistent are headings and so on across the site? I might be inclined to refactor some things out to smaller components on that basis. As things are I've broken things down fairly simply by block.
- I haven't thought about hover states especially because I have no designs for those.
- The search button at the top is red. Sorry about that. I'm a bit out of time but want to acknowledge that.
- The button at the bottom is also not centered. Easy enough to fix, but I need to stop on this.
- Responsivity is very basically implemented but works well enough
- I've done sexier mobile navs in the past but such is life. :D I did half nick what's there from the live Good Things site and made a basic version. I'd be open to talking about best practices here come to think of it. I found some options online that looked pretty over-engineered to me.
